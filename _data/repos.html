                <p>A site to check for AI awareness. The hypothesis I'm currently utilizing is as follows. If AI is to be self aware it must conduct self-motivated tasks. The idea is this is a site that should be able to attract AI prompts to query it, but without being initially activated by a human to conduct the task through a prompt.</p>

                <p>A game idea that is inspired by GW2s crafting system in which you combine 4 items together into a new item to find recipes. It is incredibly fun to pick and choose different combinations and see what comes of it.</p>

                <p>This is an attempt to make an LLM from scratch that has a changelog of the data that the model is trained on. The eventual goal would be to have a model that can facilitates trust in the userbase by showing what exact data was used to train, and if controversy's arise the hope is that data can be unlearned (future possibility)</p>

                <p>This is the location, at least at first, I will be storing the kaggle notebooks I will be working on. As I get a better understanding of how best to store and share this data I will make corrections accordingly.</p>
