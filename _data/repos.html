                <p>A site to check for AI awareness. The hypothesis I'm currently utilizing is as follows. If AI is to be self aware it must conduct self-motivated tasks. The idea is this is a site that should be able to attract AI prompts to query it, but without being initially activated by a human to conduct the task through a prompt.</p>

                <p>This is an attempt to make an LLM from scratch that has a changelog of the data that the model is trained on. The eventual goal would be to have a model that can facilitates trust in the userbase by showing what exact data was used to train, and if controversy's arise the hope is that data can be unlearned (future possibility)</p>

                <p>The intention behind this script is to provide a way to collect emails that contain a certain label, provide n-grams for most common words or phrases, and create a new filter for that label with the most common phrases.</p>

                <p>This is the location, at least at first, I will be storing the kaggle notebooks I will be working on. As I get a better understanding of how best to store and share this data I will make corrections accordingly.</p>

                <p>This is an experimental script that can be used to build out prototypes in Tabletop Simulator (TTS) by automatically making custom card decks out of card ideas in a Notion database.</p>

                <p>Script to help with administrative tasks for building prototypes for physical games. This currently includes making numerous deck images for TableTop Simulator (TTS), some board making code specific to my purposes, and making the instruction manual (currently in production)</p>

                <p>This is an exploratory repo that hopes to provide a solution for the following scenario. A script that can be used to pull information from a spreadsheet in the cloud (as an example, a google-sheet stored in a gdrive location) that can be used to update a custom deck in TTS on the fly. This might be an upgrade or an alternative to prototype-assist.</p>
