# About Me
Thank you for reaching out to this site to learn more about me. I am a incident response analyst with a decades worth of experience in the Digital Forensics and Incident Response space (DFIR), currently embarking on a career transition into Data Science and Machine Learning. I have a lifetime of experience in coding, with more than a decade worth of experience in using python specifically. I'm very big in building out automations and forensic tools that help investigators conduct their investigations more efficiently.

This site is a work in progress, and is still being actively built out, but for now you can track my progress in [my journey](/my-journey/) page.
